This project demonstrates how to securely encrypt and decrypt messages using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Python. It compares both CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) and ECB (Electronic Codebook) modes using the cryptography library.

üîê Features

AES-256 encryption using CBC and ECB modes

Randomly generated secure key (256-bit) and IV (for CBC)

Padding logic to meet AES block size requirements

Clear output showing encrypted and decrypted messages

üñºÔ∏è Example Output

Below is an actual screenshot showing the script successfully encrypting and decrypting a message using both AES modes:
